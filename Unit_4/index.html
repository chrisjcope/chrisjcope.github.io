<ul>
<li>Traditional learning styles do not create sustainable change. Culture or Customer Experience change is not currently designed to integrate learning and doing. It should</li>

<li>Managers and leaders do not have the time to adapt their leadership style. They are constantly jumping from one meeting to the next</li>

<li>Very few leaders and managers apply the right tools and methodologies that encourage understanding and collaboration that could make theirs, and their teams lives easier</li>

<li>Command control, traditional management styles exist in most traditional/ large organisations that are not fit for purpose in a digital world</li>

<li>Many businesses struggle to understand Customer and Digital Transformation, as well as the importance of true collaboration</li>

<li>Taking managers and leaders out of the business on leadership training or employing consultants costs £Xbn a year, rarely driving the required cultural change</li>
</ul>
